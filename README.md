# Flask Code Challenge - Pizza Restaurants

For this assessment, you'll be working with a Pizza Restaurant domain.

The job here is to build out the Flask API to add the functionality described in the deliverables below.

Test you endpoints as stated below

Running the Flask server and using Postman to make requests

## Models

You need to create the following relationships:

- A `Restaurant` has many `Pizzas` through `RestaurantPizza`
- A `Pizza` has many Restaurants through `RestaurantPizza`
- A `RestaurantPizza` belongs to a `Restaurant` and belongs to a `Pizza`
  Start by creating the models and migrations for the following database tables:

## Validations

Add validations to the `RestaurantPizza` model:

- Must have a price between 1 and 30
  Add validations to `Restaurant` Model:

- must have a name less than 50 words in length
- must have a unique name

# Routes

Set up the following routes. Make sure to return JSON data in the format specified along with the appropriate HTTP verb.

## GET /restaurants

Return JSON data in the format below:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Dominion Pizza",
    "address": "Good Italian, Ngong Road, 5th Avenue"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Pizza Hut",
    "address": "Westgate Mall, Mwanzi Road, Nrb 100"
  }
]
```

## GET /restaurants/:id

If the `Restaurant` exists, return JSON data in the format below:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Dominion Pizza",
  "address": "Good Italian, Ngong Road, 5th Avenue",
  "pizzas": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Cheese",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Pepperoni",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `Restaurant` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

## DELETE /restaurants/:id

If the `Restaurant` exists, it should be removed from the database, along with any `RestaurantPizzas` that are associated with it (a `RestaurantPizza` belongs to a `Restaurant`, so you need to delete the `RestaurantPizzas` before the `Restaurant` can be deleted).

After deleting the `Restaurant`, return an empty response body, along with the appropriate HTTP status code.

If the `Restaurant` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

## GET /pizzas

Return JSON data in the format below:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Cheese",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Pepperoni",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
  }
]
```

## POST /restaurant_pizzas

This route should create a new `RestaurantPizza` that is associated with an existing `Pizza` and `Restaurant`. It should accept an object with the following properties in the body of the request:

```
{
  "price": 5,
  "pizza_id": 1,
  "restaurant_id": 3
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is created successfully, send back a response with the data related to the `Pizza`:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Cheese",
  "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is not created successfully, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```
